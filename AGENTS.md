This repository does not currently include automated tests. To help future agents understand past work, log notable changes and ideas in the **Agent Log** below. When you make significant updates or have suggestions, add a dated entry summarizing your thoughts.

## Agent Log
- 2024-05-22: Initial creation of `AGENTS.md` to keep a running history of changes and ideas. Remember to append future notes here.
- 2025-08-06: Updated the application's visual style for a more modern, minimalist aesthetic. Changed the basemap to Stamen Toner for a high-contrast, black-and-white look. Switched the font to "Roboto" and adjusted text sizes to make the place name more prominent.
